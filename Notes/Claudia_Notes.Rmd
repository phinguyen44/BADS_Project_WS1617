```

## Features to be constructed
- construct price ranges (0, low price, higher prices)
- statistics on purchase baskets
- statistics on customer
- item discount + max price paid
- group shoes/cloths
- account age


## Optional Features

- user profile
- historic record on purchasing and return behavior
- match customer-product pair (cite Fu et al (2016) "Fused latent model...")
- challenge: too few observations? Only 3 item per customer on 
             - more than 40% of customers have only bought one item
             - 10% of items are bought by same customer twice 
              -> probably high risk of one being returned
              
              
## Mention
- unsupervised vs supervised methods
- category for features (item, customer, time/delivery, brand, e.g.)
